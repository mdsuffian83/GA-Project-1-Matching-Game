Matching Circle Game is a simple memory game in which the player has to match pairs of circles with the same colors on them. The game consists of a board of circles with their faces down, and the player has to turn them over two at a time to try to find a match.

How to Play
To begin the game, click the "Start Game" button.

The game consists of 16 circles with different colors that are hidden.

Click on one circle to reveal its color, and then click on a second circle to try to match the color of the first circle.

If the two colors match, the circles will stay revealed, and the player will score a point.

If the colors do not match, the circles will flip back over and the player will have to try again.

The game is won when all circles have been matched.

There is a Kids mode that can be activated by clicking the "Kids Mode" button. This will display the color of all the circles on the screen.
